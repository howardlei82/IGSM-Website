Exclude plugins from appearing in plugins menu for normal user in WordPress multisite.

== Description ==

WordPress 3.0 multisite allows us only to show or hide all of the plugins from normal user,
nothing else. If we want to allow all users to use some simple plugins, while hiding the 
*super* plugins only for Super Admins or VIP users, we have to activate the plugin for all
network in order to make it work. Or else, we have to make them visible by all.

This is why we need Exclude Plugins. Exclude Plugins will exclude plugins from appearing
in plugins menu for normal user in WordPress multisite. This way, some plugins (excluded
plugins) will be available only for Super Admins, while other plugins (included plugins)
will be available for normal user.

If you're **not** using Network Mode/MultiSite in WordPress 3.0, you definitely **not** needing this plugin.
Here's [how to activate the multisite option](http://itx.web.id/wordpress/mengaktifkan-opsi-multisite-dalam-wordpress-3-0/).
